Hello, My Name is Adrian Cederberg!
===============================================================================

I am an engineer from Albuquerque, New Mexico. Lately I am interested in 
writing software as I have found it to be an indispensible skill in the 
various persuits that interest me. My technical interests include mathematics,
physics, and software. 

At the moment, I am working on captura, an easy to extend sharing API 
framework from which I intend to make a few other projects. I have also built 
this blog site on top of captura, and this document that you are reading is 
stored in captura.

History
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I first found my interest in computers as a young teenager. I played around by
jailbreaking my iPod, HTML sheets, and more. Eventually, I forgot about this 
as I had other interests (principally music and sport). 

About two years in to college (while getting my applied mathematics degree) I 
had to take a class in matlab. I found matlab to be very easy to pick up and 
quite enjoyed it and found myself to be a bit ahead of my peers - however there 
was one very big downside - the limitted applications and expensive licensing 
of matlab made it inconvenient. 

To this end, I decided that it would make more sense to learn python as it did
not have the aforementioned limitations. Python was easy to learn, get started
with, and build basic scripts with. Further, I liked that I did not have to use
the matlab IDE. Eventually I took a course in python at UNM where I gained some 
more formal knowledge of software. 

I further honed my skills working as a research assistent by building and 
programming devices to record experimental data consisting of magnetic (vector)
fields as well as plotting and maintaining this data. 

In spring 2020 I decided to leave graduate school after only one semester as
it was beyond silly to pay the universities exorbident fees for online classes.
At this point, I had decided that software was my most marketable skill and 
that I wanted to go forth and make a living.

I took the time to teach myself about the development and deployment of web 
applications. At this time, I learned how to use libraries like ``flask`` 
and ``sqlalchemy``, databases like ``mysql`` and ``mongodb``, deployment tools
such as ``ansible``, ``docker``, and ``kubernetes`` by putting together a 
portfolio to have proof of ability. *This code isn't available publicly, 
however if you truely want to see it ask me for a link.* 

At the age of 24, I was living off what little saving I had from college, 
living in the cheapest house I could find, making money by working for my land-
lord, and without a car (I had never owned a car at this point). The pressure 
to succeed in aquiring finance was dire - A continued to aquire skills by 
completing a number of small projects while I applied for jobs. I was shocked 
when I got calls back, but the job offers were at first less than appealing.

Finally, after rejecting some not so great job offers, I landed an interview 
with amazon. I made it to final interviews, however in the end the jobs shoes
were too big for a first-timer such as myself. Eventually, I did get a job.
