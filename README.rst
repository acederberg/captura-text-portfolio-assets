===============================================================================

The site is built from the content of `captura-text-portfolio-assets <github.com/acederberg/captura-text-portfolio-assets>`_ using the
`text extension <github.com/acederberg/captura-text>`_ for `captura <github.com/acederberg/captura>`.

for instance) would be overkill for my purpose and would fail to show a use-case for ``captura``.

All of the pages on this site are stored and served by captura, and all ``HTML``
pages are actually rendered from restructured text.

The ``text`` extension for captura makes it extremely simple to deploy some 
web assets (``html``, ``css``, ``svg``, etc) to a captura instance. For the 
moment, ``captura-text`` is available only for those deploying captura 
instances. Soon users will be able to share, collaborate, and publish articles 
using this extension.

To see the building specification inspect ``text.yaml``. To use with ``captura-text``, 
just clone this into the ``docs`` dir and
