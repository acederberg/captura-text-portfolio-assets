Education
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**University of New Mexico, Spring 2015 - Fall 2019**

-  Bachelors of Science in applied mathematics (GPA 3.3) - Minor in
   chemistry.

-  Worked as a grader, tutor, and researcher. Got my first tastes of
   software development with ``matlab`` and ``python``.


Relevant Work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read more about my recent projects `on my
portfolio <https://acederberg.io/home>`__ or `on
github <https://github.com/acederberg>`__. This document is meant to be
a synopsis and everything will not fit - and either of these resources
will tell you more about my capabilities than this document ever could.


Founder ``Captura`` and ``acederberg.io``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**January 2024 - Now**

My personal projects which I intend to use to grow a business and apply
for a new job.

-  Designed, implemented, tested, and deployed ``Captura`` using
   ``fastapi``, ``sqlalchemy``, ``pydantic``, and ``docker``. To learn
   more about ``Captura`` and get a demo, check out the `Captura
   demo <https://captura.acederbebrg.io>`__ or run the
   ``docker-compose`` project in the `github
   repository <https://github.com/acederberg/captura>`__. Designed the
   `captura-text <https://github.com/acederberg/captura-text>`__ plugin
   to serve web assets that may be collaborated upon.

-  Implemented infrastructure as code and continuous integration and
   deployment for ``Captura`` to ``linode`` using ``pulumi`` and
   ``python``. Implemented ``SSL`` termination using ``traefik``,
   ``let’s encrypt`` ACME certificates, and ``porkbun API`` automation.
   Code is host on ``github`` but is only available upon request since
   I’d rather have deployment be opaque for the time being.

-  Built `acederberg.io <https://acederberg.io/home>`__ using the
   `captura-text <https://github.com/acederberg/captura-text>`__ plugin
   and added some simple projects for visitors to enjoy in the browser.

-  Maintained and published `a yaml configuration
   library <https://github.com/acederberg/yaml-settings-pydantic>`__.
   Added features, addressed issues, and tested.


Software Engineer and Senior Software Engineer | Mountain Vector Energy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**January 2022 - December 2023**

-  Collaborated with 3 to 4 other developers to design, implement,
   maintain, and deploy ``Cufflink`` Software as a Service from almost
   nothing. Taught and assisted struggling developers (when there were
   any), contributed to ``Cufflink`` client and admin dashboards within
   the ``react`` and ``next`` frameworks, and wrote the
   ``Cufflink API``.

-  Bootstrapped the ``Cufflink API`` from former CTOs notes/prototype
   when he unexpectedly quit (right when I started). Used ``FastAPI``,
   ``SQLAlchemy``, and ``Pydantic``. Wrote data pipelines, managed
   databases, resolved bugs, and added features. Implemented ``Auth0``
   authentication.

-  Developed infrastructure as code using ``terraform`` on ``azure`` and
   designed ``helm`` charts for ``Cufflink`` services. Managed and
   debugged services in ``kubernetes``. Built ``bitbucket`` pipelines
   for various repositories and implemented/maintained continuous
   integration and deployment. Maintained service up-time and
   reliability.

-  Used ``atlassian jira`` to track progress, keep notes, and assign
   issues.

-  Performed technical interviews to hire two software engineers.

Developer and Devops Engineer | My Portfolio and Self-Study
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Studied software 50+ hours a week because I wanted a job in the
   subject matter. Starting January 2021 and continuing until January
   2022.

-  Built a portfolio using ``flask`` and deployed it with ``ansible``
   and ``docker-compose``. Code is available upon request.

Research Assistant | University of New Mexico Department of Mechanical Engineering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Summer 2019 - Winter 2020**

-  Collaborated with Craig Davidson of Dark Sea Industries to develop
   and document relatively efficient air plasma production using
   magnetohydrodynamic methods.

-  Built and programmed sensor arrays using Raspberry and Arduino and
   wrote drivers in ``python`` and ``c``.

-  Processed experimental data using ``python`` to generate graphs.
   Interpreted spectrometer data using ``python`` to increase
   productivity. Built various components for experimental setup
   including a power supply array.

Grader | University of New Mexico Department of Mathematics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Fall 2019 and Fall 2020**

-  Provided useful feedback and grading on undergraduate homework on a
   routine basis. Courses include partial differential equations, linear
   algebra, and college algebra. Worked in coordination with professors.

Tutor | University of New Mexico Math and Learning Lab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Fall 2017 - Summer 2019**

-  Improved student outcomes in basic algebra classes using the ALEKs
   program by providing students individual attention.
